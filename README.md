# FinalProjectComputerVision
Final Project of the subject of Computer Vision. Made with @Ahmed2BP.
* Build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to detect pneumonia with chest x-ray images.
* Fine-Tuned Resnet50 (trained with Imagenet) to obtain 94.54% accuracy.
* We apply ImageDataGenerator to balance the classes.
* We used TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
